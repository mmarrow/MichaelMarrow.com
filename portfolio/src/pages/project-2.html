        I was the lead Front-End Developer on the BHTV team.  This was a large codebase that Bright House forked from Time Warner. My responsibilities included making UI/UX design and development. My day to day in this role mostly included CSS updates via a very robust SASS architecture as well as jQuery to handle user interations and events. The front-end was built with backbone.js framework which I also did some work on.
