        This was a project with a very agressive deadline. The design of the site was done by a local agecny and handed over to me. I used foundation framework to quickly whip up a fully responsive layout. The design called for a parallax scroll effect which I tweaked a jQuery plugin to make it fit my needs for this project. We also integrated googlemaps API to allow customers to find businesses local to them. The core technologies used for this project were Foundation Framework, SASS, jQuery/JavaScript, Google Maps API all wrapped in a .NET MVC backend.
