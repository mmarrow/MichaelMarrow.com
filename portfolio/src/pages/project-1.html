        Bright House Networks was in the mist of adding a new look and feel as well as an integrate eCommerce platform to their residential services site. They had a mobile  version of the main site that they also wanted to look like the updated main site. 
      </p>
      <p>
        While time and budget did not allow a single fully responsive site to be built from the ground up. I was tasked with updating the mobile site from where it was. It hadn't been touched in about a year. Content was outdated and it was built using jQuery UI which gave it a dated look. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I approached the project like I would a ground up mobile first site. I worked with Marketing, Stakeholders and Department leads to gather requirements and do content discovery. Once the content was finalized I moved to the design phase. Using a mobile first approach Wireframes where created to map out the information architecture. From there I created a rough prototype using bootstrap so that I could demo and get feedback and approval before developing the final product. Once I moved in to development all CSS, jQueryUI and JavaScript was removed from the existing version. Using Bootstrap framework, SASS and jQuery I created an elegant user friendly mobile site with the flexibility to be enhanced so that it eventually could become a responsive version of the main site.
