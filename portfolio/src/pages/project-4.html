        The project had already been started by another company but they were not happy with the look or methods used to build the site as it had stood. Novartis Pharmaceuticals brought myself and a colleague on to this project to get it back on track. I signed on as a UI/UX Designer and worked with my colleague who was the Front-end Lead. The project had been started using jquery and css. The layout didn't look good and a lot of the interactivity on the client side was buggy. While my colleague discussed possible approaches and frameworks to use on the client side. I worked to improve the look and feel of the UI. In a very short period of time we stripped out the prior code and began building using a more robust client side stack. Over the course of 4 months we used AngularJS, Gulp, SASS, JavaScript, Bower, NPM, and JenkinsCI to complete the project and implement automated builds.
